# Theme specification

Themes are either modules that export a `StenoTheme` object or local directories loaded with the
conventions described in [Themes and Tau](theme_development.md).

```ts
import type { StenoTheme } from "jsr:@steno/steno";

export default {
  name: "my-theme",
  version: "1.0.0",
  layouts: { layout: "<main>{@html content}</main>" },
  components: { Header: "<header>{title}</header>" },
  assets: { "site.css": "main { max-width: 70ch }" },
  defaultConfig: { accent: "indigo" },
} satisfies StenoTheme;
```

`name`, `version`, and `layouts` are required. `assets` maps output-relative paths to strings,
`Uint8Array`s, or URLs. Optional `plugins` are trusted, in-process code, so they run with Steno's
own Deno permissions unless you set `pluginSourcePolicy.allowThemePlugins` to `false`.

`configSchema` declares `string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean`, `array`, or `object` settings.
Fields support `required`, `default`, `description`, and `enum`. Strings support `minLength`,
`maxLength`, and `pattern`; numbers support `minimum` and `maximum`; arrays support `items`,
`minItems`, and `maxItems`; objects support nested `properties` and `additionalProperties: false`.

Use `oneOf` to require exactly one matching alternative, or `anyOf` to require at least one. Each
alternative is a full field schema, including nested objects, arrays, or unions. A union may omit
`type`; when supplied, `type` and all other outer constraints also apply. For example:

```yaml
configSchema:
  accent_color:
    default: indigo
    oneOf:
      - type: string
      - type: array
        minItems: 1
        items:
          anyOf:
            - type: string
              enum: [indigo, rose]
            - type: object
              additionalProperties: false
              properties:
                h: { type: number, required: true, minimum: 0, maximum: 360 }
                s: { type: number, required: true, minimum: 0, maximum: 100 }
                l: { type: number, required: true, minimum: 0, maximum: 100 }
```

Alternatives must be non-empty arrays. Overlapping alternatives such as `number` and `integer`
reject integers under `oneOf`, but accept them under `anyOf`. Put `default` and `required` on the
containing field: Steno does not choose defaults from union alternatives.

Schema defaults, `defaultConfig`, and site `themeConfig` get applied in that order, then validated.
The top-level merge is shallow, but schema validation and defaults can go recursive. Undeclared
top-level keys are allowed, for backwards compatibility. An invalid value fails theme loading with a
path straight to the offending setting - that fails `steno build` outright, and only prints as a
warning in `steno dev`; see
[How Steno reports problems](troubleshooting.md#how-steno-reports-problems).

## Extending a bundled theme

Each official theme's `mod.ts` exports its `StenoTheme` object as the module default, on top of
being loadable directly as `theme: jsr:@steno/theme-minimal`. Import that object and hand it to
`mergeTheme` to override or add to it, without repeating everything it already defines:

```ts
import { mergeTheme } from "jsr:@steno/steno";
import minimal from "jsr:@steno/theme-minimal";

export default mergeTheme(minimal, {
  layouts: {
    // Overrides "layout"; every other layout from `minimal` is untouched.
    layout: `<main class="custom">{@html content}</main>`,
  },
  defaultConfig: { accent: "indigo" },
}) satisfies StenoTheme;
```

`mergeTheme(base, overrides)` merges `layouts`, `components`, `assets`, `configSchema`, and
`defaultConfig` shallowly, key by key: a key present in `overrides` replaces that entry in `base`,
and every other key from `base` survives untouched. `name`, `version`, and `plugins` get replaced
wholesale when `overrides` sets them, otherwise `base`'s value sticks. This is exactly why
`mergeTheme` exists instead of a plain object spread: overriding one entry with
`{ ...minimal, layouts: { layout: "..." } }` replaces the whole `layouts` object, so any other
layout, component, or asset `base` ships (for example `theme-marketing-minimal`'s four separate
`assets` entries) would silently vanish too. `mergeTheme` merges each of those objects key by key
instead, so only the entry you actually named in `overrides` changes.

This only applies to module-based themes (an importable `StenoTheme` object). A directory-based
theme (`theme.yaml`) has its own equivalent - `extends` - covered next.

## Extending a directory theme

A directory theme (`theme.yaml`) overrides another directory theme by setting `extends`:

```yaml
# theme.yaml
name: My Minimal
version: 1.0.0
extends: jsr:@steno/theme-minimal
```

```text
theme/
├── theme.yaml
└── layouts/
    └── layout.tau   # overrides "layout"; every other layout from theme-minimal is untouched
```

`extends` accepts one of the three bundled specifiers (`jsr:@steno/theme-minimal`,
`jsr:@steno/theme-docs-minimal`, `jsr:@steno/theme-marketing-minimal`, resolved from Steno's own
packaged copy, no network request) or a local path starting with `.`, `/`, or `file://` - relative
paths resolve against the extending theme's own directory, not the current working directory, so the
theme keeps working regardless of where `steno build` runs from. Arbitrary `jsr:`, `npm:`, or
`https:` module specifiers aren't accepted here - a directory theme's `extends` always resolves to
another `theme.yaml` directory, never an importable `StenoTheme` module; use `mergeTheme` from a
module theme instead if you need that.

Layouts, components, assets, `configSchema`, and `defaultConfig` merge exactly like `mergeTheme`
above: a file the child theme redeclares (same layout name, same component key, same asset path)
replaces the base's, everything else survives. `name` and `version` always come from the child.
Chains can go more than one level deep (`extends` all the way up); a theme that appears twice in its
own chain fails to load with a clear "circular extends chain" error instead of hanging.

## Resolution

`theme` accepts a few different forms:

1. One of the three bundled theme specifiers, `jsr:@steno/theme-minimal`,
   `jsr:@steno/theme-docs-minimal`, or `jsr:@steno/theme-marketing-minimal`, which Steno loads from
   its own bundled copy without a network request.
2. A local path (starting with `.`, `/`, or `file://`). If the directory contains `theme.yaml` or
   `theme.yml`, it loads as a convention-based directory theme; see
   [Themes and Tau](theme_development.md). Otherwise Steno looks for `mod.ts`, `theme.ts`, or
   `index.ts`, in that order, and imports the first one found as a module exporting a `StenoTheme`.
   A local directory with neither a theme manifest nor one of those three files fails to load.
3. Any other specifier (`jsr:`, `npm:`, or `https:`) is imported directly as a module exporting a
   `StenoTheme`.

## Theme functions

Register trusted helpers on a module theme with `functions`. The same helper works as an
inline call or a pipe filter; filters pass the piped value as the first argument.

```typescript
const theme: StenoTheme = {
  name: "my-theme",
  version: "1.0.0",
  layouts: { layout: '{translate("hello")} {"hello" | translate}' },
  functions: {
    translate: (key: unknown) => (key === "hello" ? "Hello" : String(key)),
  },
};
```

For a directory theme, point `theme.yaml` at a local module inside the theme directory:

```yaml
functions: ./functions.ts
```

```typescript
// functions.ts
export default {
  translate: (key: unknown) => String(key).toUpperCase(),
  link: (path: unknown) => `/docs/${String(path)}`,
};
```

Helpers may be synchronous or asynchronous. They are available in layouts, components, and
includes, and receive only their explicit arguments. Pass page or theme values as arguments
when needed. Results are HTML-escaped in `{helper()}`; use `{@html helper()}` only for trusted
HTML. Names must be valid Tau identifiers. Registered helpers take precedence over page
variables and built-in filters with the same name, without changing another theme's registry.
`mergeTheme` and directory `extends` merge helpers by name, with the child winning.

Helper modules execute trusted JavaScript with the build process's permissions, just like
module themes; they are not sandboxed plugins. YAML accepts only `./` paths contained within
the theme directory, including after symlink resolution. Helpers can import their own
dependencies. Development reloads refresh the entry module; restart the process after changing
its imported dependencies.

Compiled Tau templates remain shared, but helpers are resolved for each render. Since function
closures cannot be serialized reliably, themes with helpers invalidate persistent page caches
when a new theme instance is loaded. Repeated builds with the same instance retain a stable
signature. Themes without helpers keep their existing cache behavior.
