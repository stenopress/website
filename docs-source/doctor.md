# Doctor

Not sure why your site won't build, or want a second opinion before you ship? Run:

```sh
deno x jsr:@steno/steno doctor
```

It inspects your project and prints a report, without building anything or touching a single file.
Below is exactly what it checks and how to read the result.

## Checks

- **Deno version**: warns if the runtime is older than 2.0.0.
- **Config file**: fails and stops immediately if the config path (default
  `content/.steno/config.yml`, or `--config`) does not exist or fails to parse.
- **Content directory**: fails if `contentDir` does not exist.
- **Markdown pages**: warns if no `.md` files are found under `contentDir`.
- **Output directory**: informational only. Reports whether `output` already exists; it is created
  on build either way.
- **Data directory**: informational. Reports whether `contentDir/_data` exists; it is optional.
- **Theme**: warns if no `theme` is declared, since pages then render as plain HTML with no layout.
  If the theme is a local path (starts with `.` or `/`), fails when that directory does not exist.
- **Plugins**: reports the declared count, and how many are `isolated` versus `trusted`. Trusted
  plugins produce a warning, since they run in-process with Steno's own Deno permissions. Each
  plugin specifier is checked against the supported formats (`jsr:`, `npm:`, `file://`, `https://`);
  an unsupported format fails the check.
- **Plugin source policy**: warns when `pluginSourcePolicy.allowLocal` or `allowRemoteHttp` is
  enabled, since both widen which plugin sources may load in-process code. Also warns that
  `allowNodeBuiltins` only filters the top-level specifier and does not control transitive imports.
- **Collections**: informational. Reports the number of explicitly configured collections;
  collections are otherwise auto-detected from content subdirectories regardless of this count.
- **Redirects**: reports the declared redirect count when greater than zero.

## Exit behavior

A failing check (missing config, missing content directory, missing local theme directory, or an
unsupported plugin specifier) marks the run as having errors, prints a summary line asking you to
fix them and try again, and exits with process exit code `1`. Anything else just produces an
informational or warning line and doesn't fail the run; a clean run exits `0`.
